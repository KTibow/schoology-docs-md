# Testing Your App

As an app developer, you will want to test your application in a variety of different contexts â€“ including, but not limited to:

- as a course/group admin
- as a course/group member
- on a student's homepage
- on a teacher's homepage
- on a parent's homepage

Of course, the contexts that will apply depend on what your application does.

## Create Accounts

You have access to your own Schoology installation where you can create roles, users, courses, or groups like a regular Schoology administrator.

### Users

Click on the **Edit Users** tab on the left side of the homepage. From there, you can create/edit users, add roles, and set permissions for each role.

### Courses

On the top navigation bar, click on **Courses**, and then click on **Create**. To see a full list of previously created courses, click on **See All** or **Browse Courses**. From within a course profile, you can add users to the course or promote users to be course administrators (teachers) by clicking on the **Members** tab.

### Groups

On the top navigation bar, click on **Groups**, and then click on **Create**. To see a full list of previously created groups, click on **See All**. From within a group profile, you can add users to the group or promote users to be group administrators by clicking on the **Members** tab.

## Push Installations

Once you have created test users, courses, and/or groups, you can install any application you have created to those areas. To do so, navigate to a user/course/group profile and click on the **Test app here** button. You can then choose to install or uninstall any of your apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Even though you push applications by looking at a user's profile, that user will see and open the application from their homepage.
