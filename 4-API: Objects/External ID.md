# External ID

Sections: Look up a section by its section school code. This is generally used to link Schoology with an external system. For instance, if you have entered a section's section school code to be consistent with a Student Information System (SIS), and you would like to find a section by that section's SIS ID, you can use this API call to do so.

Users: Look up a user by their Schoology Unique ID. This is generally used to link Schoology with an external system. For instance, if you have stored the Schoology Unique ID to be consistent with a Student Information System (SIS), and you would like to find a user by their SIS ID, you can use this API call to do so.
